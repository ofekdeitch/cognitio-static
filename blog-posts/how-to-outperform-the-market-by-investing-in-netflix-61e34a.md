The primary goal of stock picking is to achieve returns that surpass the market average. If you successfully identify and invest in outperforming stocks, you can potentially earn higher returns than passive investors who track the market average.

However, many investors would argue that one cannot consistently beat the market. According to the Efficient Market hypothesis, stock prices already reflect all available information, making it nearly impossible to consistently beat the market by picking individual stocks.

Investing in individual stocks, especially those of a single company like Netflix, can be riskier than diversifying. While there's potential for higher returns, there's also a higher risk of losing your investment if the company faces challenges.

So while we at SigmaLab do not recommend cherry-picking your stocks, trying to figure out if a specific stock outperformed the market is an interesting exercise.
