## Calculating the Ratio

In order to calculate the ratio of gold to silver price, divide the price of gold by the price of silver. 

Letâ€™s take 12 October, 2020 as an example. 

Price of gold: $1922.94

Price of silver $25.11

Gold to silver price ratio: 1922.94 / 25.11 = 76.58

## The Meaning of the Ratio

To put it simply, this ratio tells us how many ounces of silver it takes to buy an ounce of gold. A ratio of 2 means one ounce of gold would cost two ounces of silver.

## Buying Gold and Silver

There are several ways to diversify your portfolio with gold and silver. The most popular options are:

### Bullion Coins and Bars

You can purchase physical gold and silver in the form of coins or bars from reputable dealers or mints. Look for products that have a high purity level and are widely recognized, such as American Gold Eagles or Canadian Silver Maple Leafs. Storing these metals securely is crucial to protect your investment.

### Gold and Silver ETFs

You can invest in gold and silver through exchange-traded funds that track the price of these metals. ETFs provide a way to gain exposure to the precious metals market without holding physical assets. Some popular gold and silver ETFs include SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and iShares Silver Trust (SLV).
